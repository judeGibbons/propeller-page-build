#Propeller page build

This is webpage built from a [layered Photoshop file provided](index.jpg).

The current status is the basic page layout, including background images and type. I will be adding functionality such as a carousel and rollovers for some of the elements.

The code is completely handwritten with no use of libraries, frameworks or preprocessors. I have tried to use a BEM-style naming convention.

**Fonts:** I have used the font Montserrat loaded from the Google Fonts API (which I wouldn't use in production), but Calluna Italic isn't available free of charge so I have subsituted the Google font Volkhov: this is a bit heavier and so looks different and in some cases runs to an extra line than it should do.

**Images:** I have not used a responsive image technique (srcset or picture) in this case but given the image-heavy nature of the page this would be best practice.
